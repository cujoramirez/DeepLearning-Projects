# Tkinter Deep Learning Applications Suite

This repository contains a suite of three desktop applications built with Tkinter that integrate deep learning for various computer vision tasks. The applications demonstrate how to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) along with techniques like Grad-CAM for model interpretability in real-world scenarios.

## Applications Overview

### 1. Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Application
- **Description:**  
  A Tkinter-based application that uses a fine-tuned Inception V3 model to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. The app integrates Grad-CAM to overlay heatmaps on images, providing insights into the regions that influenced the model’s predictions.
- **Key Features:**
  - User-friendly interface for selecting and analyzing retinal images.
  - Grad-CAM visualization for enhanced interpretability.
  - Detailed prediction metrics including confidence score, prediction certainty, and decision entropy.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python diabetic_retinopathy_app.py
  ```
- **Note:**  
  The training dataset used to build the model is very large (approximately 200GB) and is not included in this repository. Only the trained model file is provided.

### 2. Enhanced Security Check (Facial Recognition) Application
- **Description:**  
  An application designed for real-time facial recognition aimed at enhancing security (e.g., for airport check-ins). It captures live camera feed, allows you to upload a reference image (ID or passport photo), and verifies identity using deep learning models (with DeepFace).
- **Key Features:**
  - Real-time camera feed integration.
  - Option to upload a reference image for identity verification.
  - Verification history log and performance statistics such as frames per second (FPS).
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python facial_recognition_app.py
  ```

### 3. Skin Type Detection Application
- **Description:**  
  This application predicts skin type in real time using a CNN model (based on a fine-tuned ResNet50). It also implements Grad-CAM for visualization to show which image regions contribute to the prediction.
- **Key Features:**
  - Live camera feed for real-time analysis.
  - File upload option for static image analysis.
  - Grad-CAM visualization for understanding model predictions.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python skin_type_detection_app.py
  ```

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.7 or higher
- **Libraries:**  
  - Tkinter (included with Python)
  - TensorFlow
  - OpenCV
  - Pillow
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - DeepFace (for Facial Recognition)
  - PyTorch, TorchVision (for Skin Type Detection)
  - Additional packages as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Model Files:**
   - Place the Diabetic Retinopathy model (e.g., `diabetic_retinopathy_model_99.h5`) into the designated `models/` folder (or update the model path in the script).
   - Similarly, add the Skin Type Detection model file (e.g., `best_model.pth`) into the appropriate folder.
   - Note: The large dataset used for training is not included.
